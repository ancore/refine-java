# This workflow will build a package using Maven and then publish it to GitHub packages when a release is created
# For more information see: https://github.com/actions/setup-java/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#apache-maven-with-a-settings-path
# Note - The testing and checkstyle phases are disabled, because there is a CI pipeline which guarantees that the master branch is green at all times. Also this will reduce the time for the release process.
# However the dependency vulnerability check is still on, because there might be Sec-DBs update, between the release an the last CI pipelines.
